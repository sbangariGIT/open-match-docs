## Setting up


Currently, Open Match supports only open-source projects. Please ensure your project is hosted in a public GitHub repository before installing the bot.

We’ve designed the bot to work seamlessly, requiring no additional action from you after installation.
Once installed, everything will function as intended, allowing your project to be indexed and matched with the right contributors effortlessly.
